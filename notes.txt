object  is nothing but key value pair


value = { UserName : "Clerk" , CityName : "Bangolore"};


Array is nothing but multiple values
[{ UserName : "Clerk" , CityName : "Bangolore"},
{ UserName : "James" , CityName : "UK"}];


For handliong the Angular form validations
1. TemplateApproach   
-> we are taking the form object from DOM

2. ReactiveApproach   -> 
we are creating the form object in typescript and sync into the DOM
